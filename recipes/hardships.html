            <p>
                According to Marcus Aurelius we should not fear external hardships such as pain,
                death, poverty, or the various challenges of the human condition. Instead, our primary fear should be abdicating moral
                responsibility and falling short of being a complete human being.
            </p>

                He acknowledges that negative events and adversities are inevitable in life. Marcus advises against futile efforts such as praying
                for negative events not to happen. He suggests accepting that these challenges will occur because nothing cane be done
                to prevent them. The focus, according to Marcus, should be on how to react to these events.
            </p>

                When adversity comes, Marcus Aurelius encourages a Stoic response. He advises against complaining and instead advocates
                for action and endurance. He reminds us that  individuals can control their reactions to events, even if they can't control the events themselves.
