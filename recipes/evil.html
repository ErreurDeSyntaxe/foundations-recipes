            <p>
                Marcus Aurelius acknowledges the existence of what he refers to as "evil" or "bad" people,
                asserting that they are simply part of the universe. He discourages the idea of expecting the world not to present these
                individuals and likens it to asking a vine to exist without thorns. The acknowledgement of bad people is woven into his
                understanding of the natural order, and he encourages looking inward when dealing with them.

                Marcus believes in kindness and posits that people, when doing wrong, are often driven by ignorance rather than a
                deliberate desire to do harm. While he acknowledges the possibility of trying to teach these individuals, he also
                recognizes that it might not always be an option. The Stoic philosophy encourages acceptance of the uncontrollable
                aspects of life, including encounters with individuals deemed immoral or wicked. Marcus urges self-reflection and
                refraining from judgment, emphasizing that everyone, including himself, has faults.
