        <p>We agree that casseroles look unappetizing, but it is a small price to pay for the pleasure of eating this excellent dish.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Green beans: 14.5 ounces of drained green beans</li>
            <li>Mushroom soup: 10.5 ounces of cream mushroom soup</li>
            <li>Cheddar: 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Onions: 6 ounces of French-fried onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix green beans and condensed soup together in a large microwave-safe bowl until well combined. Microwave on high until
            warm, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese into the green bean mixture. Microwave on high for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture to a casserole dish and spread evenly over the bottom. Sprinkle French-fried onions over top, then
            sprinkle with remaining Cheddar.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and the onions are just turning brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
