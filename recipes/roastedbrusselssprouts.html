        <p>Many of us have bad memories of forcing Brussels sprouts down our throats. If therapy did not help you recover from the trauma, this recipe surely will.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Brussels sprouts: One pound of whole, clean and trimmed Brussels sprouts</li>
            <li>Bacon: Four slices, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>Salt: 1/2 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Pepper: 1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Olive oil: 1/4 cup of extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Maple syrup: 3 tablespoons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum
            foil.</li>
            <li>Trim ends off Brussels sprouts and cut any large ones in half. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add bacon, salt, and pepper to the Brussels spouts. Drizzle olive oil and maple syrup over top and toss until sprouts
            are well coated.</li>
            <li>Transfer to the prepared baking sheet and spread in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until bacon is crispy and Brussels sprouts are caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes, stirring
            halfway through.</li>
            <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
