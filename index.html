            <p class="quotation-content">
            Stoicism takes the position that the wise, the good man, the 
            philosopher is a man who lives in accordance with nature. He 
            fears only abdicating his moral responsibility. He is not 
            afraid of pain. He is not afraid of death. He is not afraid 
            of poverty. He is not afraid of any of the vicissitudes of 
            the Human Condition. He fears only that he should let 
            himself down and that he should be less than a complete 
            human being.

            <h2>Who was Marcus Aurelius?</h2>
            <div class="biography">
                Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor and philosopher, 
                became the ruler of Rome in 161 AD, serving until 
                his death in 180 AD. Recognized as one of the 
                "Five Good Emperors," he reigned over the last part of 
                the Pax Romana, or Roman Peace. Throughout his rule, 
                Marcus Aurelius faced challenges, including military 
                campaigns against Germanic tribes and the Parthian Empire. 
                Despite the the precedent of decadence and hedonism, he 
                maintained a reputation for integrity and self-discipline, 
                embodying Stoic principles in both his personal and 
                political life.
            </div>
            <h2><cite>Meditations</cite>: The Wisest Man's Diary</h2>
            <div class="meditations">
                <cite>Meditations</cite> is a series of personal writings 
                by Marcus Aurelius, providing a profound glimpse into his 
                inner thoughts and philosophical reflections. Composed as 
                a form of self-examination and guidance, the work is a 
                collection of stoic wisdom that explores themes of virtue, 
                resilience, and the nature of existence.
                
                Divided into twelve books, <cite>Meditations</cite> offers 
                a unique perspective on leadership, ethics, and the 
                challenges of life. Written in a practical and 
                straightforward style, the emperor-philosopher's diary 
                contemplates the transient nature of human experience and 
                the importance of living in accordance with reason and virtue.
                
                The philosophical insights presented in <cite>Meditations</cite> 
                have transcended time, making the work a timeless source of
                inspiration for individuals seeking wisdom and guidance in 
                navigating the complexities of life. Marcus Aurelius'
                reflections continue to resonate with readers across the 
                centuries, making <cite>Meditations</cite> a classic in the 
                realm of philosophical literature.

            <h2>Journaling: Becoming Marcus Aurelius</h2>
            <div class="journaling">
                Ryan Holiday, a prominent author of stoic philosophy, 
                considers journaling a pilar of stoicism. Holiday encourages
                individuals to engage in regular self-reflection, to examine 
                their thoughts and actions, and to learn from their
                experiences. Journaling, in this context, serves as a way 
                to practice and learn stoicism. Holiday claims that 
                philosophy isn't something we read once and understand. 
                Rather, it is an active practice and something one does with oneself.
