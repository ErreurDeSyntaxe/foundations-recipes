                Stoicism takes the position that the wise, the good man, the 
                philosopher is a man who lives in accordance with nature. He 
                fears only abdicating his moral responsibility. He is not 
                afraid of pain. He is not afraid of death. He is not afraid 
                of poverty. He is not afraid of any of the vicissitudes of 
                the Human Condition. He fears only that he should let 
                himself down and that he should be less than a complete 
                human being.
