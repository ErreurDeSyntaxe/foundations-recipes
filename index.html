          Stoicism takes the position that the wise, the good man, the
          philosopher is a man who lives in accordance with nature. He fears
          only abdicating his moral responsibility. He is not afraid of pain. He
          is not afraid of death. He is not afraid of poverty. He is not afraid
          of any of the vicissitudes of the Human Condition. He fears only that
          he should let himself down and that he should be less than a complete
          human being.

        <h2>Who was Marcus Aurelius?</h2>
        <p class="more-info-content">
          Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor and philosopher, became the ruler of
          Rome in 161 AD, serving until his death in 180 AD. Recognized as one
          of the "Five Good Emperors," he reigned over the last part of the Pax
          Romana, or Roman Peace. Throughout his rule, Marcus Aurelius faced
          challenges, including military campaigns against Germanic tribes and
          the Parthian Empire. Despite the the precedent of decadence and
          hedonism, he maintained a reputation for integrity and
          self-discipline, embodying Stoic principles in both his personal and
          political life.

          Aurelius, providing a profound glimpse into his inner thoughts and
          philosophical reflections. Composed as a form of self-examination and

          philosophical insights presented in <cite>Meditations</cite> have
          transcended time, making the work a timeless source of inspiration for

          of life. Marcus Aurelius' reflections continue to resonate with

        <h2>Journaling: Becoming Marcus Aurelius</h2>
        <p class="more-info-content">
          Ryan Holiday, a prominent author of stoic philosophy, considers
          journaling a pilar of stoicism. Holiday encourages individuals to
          engage in regular self-reflection, to examine their thoughts and
          actions, and to learn from their experiences. Journaling, in this
          context, serves as a way to practice and learn stoicism. Holiday
          claims that philosophy isn't something we read once and understand.
          Rather, it is an active practice and something one does with oneself.
