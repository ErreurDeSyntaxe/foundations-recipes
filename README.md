My First Odin Project: A Recipe Website
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few 
recipes.

# November 22
Commit early and often. Just like castling in chess. Hopefully this is a lesson 
learned. Also, flexbox is fun and useful, but it's a bitch to learn XD


# After Foundations: First Entry

I completed the Foundations course of The Odin Project today. I am very pleased
with the progress of the past month. Tomorrow, I plan on reading other 
solutions' source code to see how others have achieve similar results and how
others accomplished much better with less. 

The idea of looking back on my progress made me think of this project, aka the
first project. I had found a friend's work and was amazed by it. Now, my 
design skills are still pretty bad, and I'll do something about that, but my 
coding skills and knowledge have improved a lot, so I want to take another
shot at making a "recipe" website. 

The new angle is the philosophy of stoicism. It is something that has become 
meaningful, helpful, and dear to me. Building a website around stoicism will 
help me understand the philosophy better.
