# foundations-recipes
My First Odin Project: a recipe website that will consist of a main index page 
which will have links to a few recipes. I came back to this project many times 
during the Foundations course to practice new skills and to have fun.

# Diary

-At one point, I hadn't committed anything in a long while, and the website
stopped working. I panicked and struggled with Git to revert back to a working
version, but in the end, I had to manually undo the changes. Lesson learned?  

-I completed the Foundations course of The Odin Project today. I am very pleased
with the progress of the past month. Tomorrow, I plan on reading other 
solutions' source code to see how others have achieve similar results and how
others accomplished much better with less.  

The idea of looking back on my progress made me think of this project, aka the
first project. I had found a friend's work and was amazed by it. Now, my 
design skills are still pretty bad, and I'll do something about that, but my 
coding skills and knowledge have improved a lot, so I want to take another
shot at making a "recipe" website.  

The new angle is the philosophy of stoicism. It is something that has become 
meaningful, helpful, and dear to me. Building a website around stoicism will 
help me understand the philosophy better.
